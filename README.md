## 📝 Tasks Included

### 🔍 Task 1: Network Packet Sniffer (Python + Scapy)

A real-time network packet sniffer built using the Scapy library. It captures and analyzes packets flowing through the network interface and extracts key information from different protocol layers.

**Features:**

- Captures IP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets
- Displays IP addresses, MAC addresses, TTL, flags, and fragmentation details
- Extracts and displays protocol-specific data (e.g., TCP ports, sequence numbers, payloads)
- Uses `scapy` for low-level packet inspection

**How to Run:**

```bash
pip install scapy
sudo Packet_Sniffer.py

```

📁 Source file: Packet_Sniffer.py
📄 Detailed explanation available in code comments as well as in README.md
