# Network Packet Sniffer

---

## Overview

This is a **Python-based network packet sniffer** that captures and analyzes real-time network traffic using the powerful `scapy` library. It prints detailed information about each packet, including source and destination addresses, protocols, ports, flags, and payloads.

Ideal for educational purposes, protocol analysis, or simply understanding how data flows through a network.

- Captures packets in **real-time**.
- Displays:
    - Source & Destination **IP and MAC addresses**
    - **Protocol** type (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
    - **Packet length**, **TTL**, **flags**, and **fragment offset**
- TCP:
    - Source & destination ports
    - Sequence and acknowledgment numbers
    - TCP flags & payload
- UDP:
    - Source & destination ports

## Notes

- Run the script with **admin/root privileges** to allow low-level packet access:
    - **Linux/macOS:** `sudo python Packet_Sniffer.py`
    - **Windows:** Run your terminal as Administrator.
- This sniffer is for **educational and testing** use. Do not use it on networks without permission.
